Full environment package list in requirements.txt

# How to setup/install the client

# How to configure and run the client

models.py includes flask commands, here's what you need to get going:  
First setup environment with  
"export FLASK_APP=bigrecipe", or "set FLASK_APP=bigrecipe" on Windows  
"export FLASK_ENV=development", or "set FLASK_ENV=development" on Windows,  
development environment just to be sure  

Populated database can be found in instance, rename it to development.db

"flask init-db"  
to initialize database  
"flask testgen"  
then  
"flask assocgen"  
to set up some initial data. Finally  
"flask run"  
to run server.  
Basically the same as in the sample project.  
Access the client through http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin/  

# Testing

Run pytest from the project folder
